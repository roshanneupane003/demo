    <h2>Message from the Vice-Chancellor</h2>
    <p>
      On behalf of the Faculty of Engineering (FoE), I would like to welcome you
      at the Far-western University. The FoE has come a long way since the
      establishment of the University in 2010. Today, the Faculty is a vibrant
      entity where enrollment is growing, infrastructure (labs and equipment) is
      improving, and the programs are receiving national and international
      attention. This incredible growth is expected to continue in future too.
      It has been a leader in engineering education in the Far-western region of
      Nepal and aims to build educational programs that prepare its students to
      make difference in the world by contributing towards societal development.
      Now, it has been offering Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and
      Computer Engineering in its School of Engineering at Mahendranagar. We
      also plan to start Bachelor of Architecture from the academic year 2024.
      With its aim to become a leading institution for higher education in
      engineering field, the FoE has also started master's degree in
      construction project management (MSc CPM) from 2023 and will start
      Structural Engineering from 2025 at its School of Engineering.Students
      from diverse geographical regions of the country are admitted pursuing
      engineering education at the FoE. Students get admission through
      competitive entrance examination conducted by the FoE. Despite the lowest
      fee structure among the Engineering institutions in Nepal, we provide
      quality education and the best academic environment to the students with
      the support of its young, dynamic and well-educated faculties. To promote
      sharing of knowledge, research and innovative ideas, and enrich students
      learning process, we invite scholars and professionals from around the
      globe and encourage our students to participate in the seminars and
      discussions. In addition, we have proposed to establish a Centre for
      Engineering Research and Innovation at our Central Campus to fulfill the
      need of carrying out research, development and innovation. The FoE has
      also been attempting to tie up with the international Universities to
      promote mutual collaboration on research and education. We encourage our
      faculty members and students to conduct research and innovative work in
      engineering field.Indeed, success in the engineering field requires more
      than a strong technical knowledge and the capacity to apply it to
      real-world problems. It also requires the ability to engage in close
      collaboration, as well as qualities like integrity, curiosity, creativity,
      open-mindedness and a willingness to engage in innovation. I encourage the
      students to enhance your academic experience by being fully engaged with
      your professors, your peers and the staff who are here to support you
      throughout your educational journey. I welcome you at the Faculty of
      Engineering to pursue your degrees and actively participate in research
      and innovation activities. Warmest Regards Assoc. Prof. Kishan Datta
      Bhatta, PhD. Dean Faculty of Engineering, Far-Western University
      Mahendranagar, Kanchanpur, Nepal We look forward to welcoming you!
